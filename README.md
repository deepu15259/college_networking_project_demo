College network architecture  model demo project involved designing and implementing a secure and efficient network model for a college demo, aimed at creating a robust network infrastructure that supports real-time communication while ensuring high levels of security and performance. The goal was to build a network that could handle various data traffic while safeguarding it against potential threats and unauthorized access.

I was responsible for designing the network topology, which included selecting appropriate routers, switches, and firewalls to facilitate secure and reliable communication. A major part of my focus was on security measures, including configuring firewalls, implementing encryption protocols, and setting up access control systems to prevent unauthorized access and protect the network from potential attacks. Additionally, I played a key role in troubleshooting network connectivity issues and optimizing performance to ensure smooth operation.

The project also involved using Cisco Packet Tracer for virtual simulations, which allowed me to test and refine the network setup before deployment. This simulation process helped us address potential issues early on and optimize the network's efficiency.

Overall, this project helped me enhance my networking and cybersecurity skills, providing me with valuable hands-on experience in network configuration, security protocol implementation, and system integration. It also improved my problem-solving and collaboration abilities, preparing me for future challenges in the field.
